### 3/1/2020, 1:00 AM - 2:00 AM - Added menu, links, stylized layout, lined input
Kurtis added a menu with links to other pages on the site, including, Documentation, Examples, and Help. He also stylized some elements of the layout.

### 3/1/2020, 3:00 PM - 5:00 PM - Added Arrays and Boolean types

### 3/17/2020, 11:00 AM - 2:30 PM - Fixed Variable evaluation Issue and Do While Loops Were Added.
Issue was discovered by Jonathan and Josiah where variables could be modified during evaluation.  A mini fix was implemented.  Do While Loops were also added.

### 3/16/2020, 7:30 PM - 8:30 PM - Back End Meeting
Josiah and Jonathan held a Zoom meeting. We troubleshooted some issues with While loops not ending when using certain variable names such as "i". This was due to the method in the script that performed phrase evaluation using the variable "i" as well.

### 3/26/2020, 4:00 PM - 5:30 PM - Documentation Meeting

Documentation will display overtop of the webpage instead of redirecting to make it easier for students to reference it. Got rid of the examples page and help page, and might move examples to the documentation page. Got rid of the light/dark theme because it is unnecessary. Made the clear button only clear the output box. Will add line numbers back to input box later.
